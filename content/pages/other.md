# Crete 1910-1920 colorized

A colorization I did using the free release of [#DeOldify](https://deoldify.ai/). The video is about my home island of Crete during the 1910-1920s. You can find it in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UJgWBluvdc).

# Dosbox PKGBUILD with the ne2000 driver

A [PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dosbox-svn-ne2000/) for Arch Linux where I adapted an older patch for the ne2000 driver that allows dosbox to access a host network interface. Fun to connect your Windows 3.11 dosbox to the exciting new world of the Internet. Usable with Winsock Trumpet or Arachne.
