# Industry / Non-published
During the 5 month internship at BBC Audio R&D I worked on creating several audio effects using the Web Audio API for an object based mixing paradigm for use in an internally developed storyboarding system. Those effects included among others a time-aligned fader and ducker. I also  worked on developing the Object-based audio effect described in [Personalization of object-based audio for accessibility using narrative importance](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/59636) using the Web Audio API, and also as a plugin for VST hosts and Avid Pro Tools. 

# MSc Projects

# Other

I also experiment once in a while with Game Design. My favourite tool at the moment is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) using the GDScript programming language.
