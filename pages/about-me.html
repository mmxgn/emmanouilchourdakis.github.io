<h1>Personal</h1>
<p>If you find Emmanouil Theofanis too long, you can just call me Manos (he/him). I am from Greece, and I speak Greek, English, and can order food in French. I love doing computer stuff such as playing with Tidal, ZynAddSubFx, and other free software music production stuff. Also designing computer games with Godot. I enjoy reading, watching, and in general living everything Sci-Fi related. Also listening to metal and industrial-related musics.</p>

<h2>Journey</h2>
<p>I recently succesfully defended my PhD thesis on Computational Methods for Assisting Radio Drama production and I will be awarded a Doctor's degree once I submit the requested corrections to my thesis document.</p>
<p>My thesis pertained to utilizing heterogeneous data (music, speech, sound effects, digital audio effects, and literary story text) to adapt short literary stories to radio drama in order to assist an aspiring radio drama production team. Machine Learning approaches (using <a href="https://spacy.io/">SpaCy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair">Flair</a>, and Scikit-Learn) were combined with lexical and commonsense knowledge bases (<a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>, <a href="http://conceptnet.io/">ConceptNet</a>) as well as rule-based methods to extract information from literary stories such as characters, locations, and emotions, recommend relevant audio assets such as music, and sound effects and finally generate production scripts and draft takes based on rules derived from best practices.</p>
<p>For part of my work I also used supervised learning  (Scikit-Learn) together with custom-developed user interfaces that capture and model how users apply a Moorer digital reverberation effect on specific types of music tracks (e.g. bass, drums, vocals). I have experience in also designing and deploying online multi stimulus listening tests for such systems (using the <a href="https://github.com/BrechtDeMan/WebAudioEvaluationTool">Web Audio Evaluation Tool</a>)  and analyzing and visualising the results using python. </p>
<p>I briefly also worked with the BBC Audio R&amp;D Team during a 5 month internship where I prototyped adaptive digital audio effects for use with the object based mixing paradigm. The effects were programmed in the FAuSt signal processing language and Javascript as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet">Web Audio Worklets</a>. One of such effects was also further developed into VST for Mac, Linux, and Windows hosts ans well as an Avid Pro Tools AAX plugin for internal use. Additionally, I collaborated with other researchers to model decisions made by radio mixing engineers when mixing for hard of hearing individuals. </p>
<p>Please see the various <a href="https://mmxgn.github.io/pages/software.html">software</a> I developed as well as my <a href="https://mmxgn.github.io/pages/research.html">publications</a> during that time.</p>
<p>I got awarded an MSc Degree by Queen Mary University of London as well and had an all around digital music processing curriculum, including theory and practice on Music Information Retrieval, Digital Audio Effects, Mathematics for Audio Signal Processing, etc. I especially focused on developing audio effects for hardware (using C and Arm Assembly) and software as VST plugins. My thesis pertained to controlling a Digital Moorer Reverberator Effect using machine learning and led to an AES Conference paper.</p>
<p>In my 5 year Dipl.-Eng Degree at the Technical University of Crete I had an all around electronic engineering and computer science curriculum, including signal processing, artificial intelligence, and low level hardware design. The graduation thesis pertained to learning musical composition rules for a computer aided musical composition system.</p>
